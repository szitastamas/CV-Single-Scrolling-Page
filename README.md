# CV-Single-Scrolling-Page

After finishing the first CV site I kept learning about CSS3 transitions and animations, positioning and all that good stuff.
Then I created this webpage, made it responsive, translated it to english, german and hungarian. I put quite a good amount of effort into it back then and was really happy when I finished it ^^
I will start working on my official CV website somewhere at the beginning of 2020... we'll see
